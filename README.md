 I'll be building an entire Website from scratch using Html, Vanilla Css and Vanilla JavaScript

 I spent 100hours trying to get this freaking navigation just to be right, and I'm nowhere done with the challenges. Looks a bit different from my figma design because I forgot to add the email and number at the top, I'll attempt that tomorrow. I'm crying just incase you can't tell.

 I really need to learn sass because all of this css is killing me oh well. ðŸ˜©
